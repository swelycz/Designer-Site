# Designer-Site
Concept site for an interior designer

This site uses all custom, hand-coded css with an SVG animation for the bouncing arrow at the bottom of the page
I used photoshop to blur background images to help them blend into the background, but also to better retain their visual integrity when I lowered their resolution in order to speed up load times.
I came up with as unique of a navigation bar as I could, with shifting menus on hover/mouse-over, expanding text, and highlighted backgrounds also on hover/mouse-over.
My goal was also to have the site utilize the entire usable window space any user has at as many resolutions as I could manage
I used jQuery for manipulating elements on hover/mouse-over
All photos used are intended to be placeholders for the designer's photos once aquired

*This site was NOT developed for mobile devices*
